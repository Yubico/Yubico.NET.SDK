# Yubico .NET SDK v2

Fallback package readme. Every shipping module has its own `src/<Module>/PACKAGE_README.md`, packed as
`README.md`; this file is used only by a packable project that does not have one yet.

> ## ALPHA - NOT FOR PRODUCTION
>
> This is a pre-release alpha. It is subject to change and has **not yet completed Yubico's formal
> security audit**. No security guarantees are made until that audit is complete. Packages are
> unsigned, and package names and namespaces may change. Provided for evaluation only.
