    /// It enables specific device type information to be preserved and accessed in event handlers.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// While this interface does not inherit from <see cref="System.EventArgs"/>, it retains the "Args" suffix
    /// in its name. This naming convention is deliberately chosen to maintain consistency with standard
    /// event argument naming patterns in C#, particularly for improved readability when used in delegate
    /// and event handler signatures. The familiar "Args" suffix clearly indicates the interface's role
    /// in event-related contexts, despite not directly extending <see cref="System.EventArgs"/>.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <typeparam name="TDevice">The specific type of <see cref="IDevice"/> this event argument represents.
