To find IOService objects that aren't yet registered, use an iterator as created by IORegistryEntryCreateIterator(). IOServiceAddMatchingNotification can also supply this information and install a notification of new IOServices.

IOKitLib can construct matching dictionaries for common criteria with helper functions such as IOServiceMatching, IOServiceNameMatching, IOBSDNameMatching.
