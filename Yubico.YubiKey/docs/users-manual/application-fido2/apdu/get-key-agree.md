### Command APDU info

CLA | INS | P1 | P2 | Lc | Data | Le
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
00 | 10 | 00 | 00 | 06 | 06 A2 01 02 02 02 | (absent)

The Ins byte (instruction) is 10, which is the byte for CTAPHID_CBOR.
That means the command information is in a CBOR encoded structure in the
Data.

The data consists of the CTAP Command Byte and the CBOR encoding of the
command's parameters. In this case, the CTAP Command Byte is `06`,
which is the command "`authenticatorClientPin`". The CBOR encoding is
the following:

```txt
  A2         map containing two elements
     01      key (of key/value) specifying ...
        0x   ... PIN/UV protocol (x=1 for protocol one, x=2 for protocol two)
     02      key specifying ...
        02   ... subcommand, 02 = KeyAgreement
```

### Response APDU info

#### Response APDU for a successful get

Total Length: *variable + 2*\
Data Length: *variable*

      Data      | SW1 | SW2

:--------------:| :---: | :---:
*encoded info* | 90 | 00

The info returned is CBOR encoded. It has a structure similar to the
following.

```txt
  A5
     01 --int--
     03 --int--
     20 --int--
     21 --byte string--
     22 --byte string--
```

The integers describe the algorithm and curve, and the byte strings are
the x- and y-coordinates of the public key.

The lengths of the byte string are dependent on the algorithm.
Currently only one algorithm is supported, ECDH using the NIST curve
P-256. That means the byte strings are both 32 bytes long. The total
length of the encoding will be 78 bytes. Hence, the total length of the
response will be 80 bytes.
