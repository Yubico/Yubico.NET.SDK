# FIDO2 commands

For each possible U2F command, there will be a class that knows how to build the command
[APDU](xref:UsersManualApdu) and parse the data in the response APDU. Each class will know
what information is needed from the caller for that command.

### SDK classes

--VersionCommand--xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.VersionCommand--

--VersionResponse--xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.VersionResponse--

### Input

None.

### Output

### APDU

[Technical APDU Details](apdu/version.md)
___

## Get info

Get information about the YubiKey's FIDO2 application.

### Available

All YubiKeys with the FIDO2 application.

### SDK classes

[GetInfoCommand](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.GetInfoCommand)

command. Most of the elements are optional, so that any one encoding may or may not have
the same subset of possible key/value pairs.

The YubiKey can return up to 20 of the defined elements. It will not return
`vendorPrototypeConfigCommands`.

Get the total number of RPs that can be found along with information about the first
relying party (RP) represented by the credentials on the YubiKey . This is one of the
subcommands of the `authenticatorCredentialManagement` command.

does not support it, the response will be "Unsupported option".

### Available

All YubiKeys with the FIDO2 application.

### SDK classes

[EnumerateRpsBeginCommand](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.EnumerateRpsBeginCommand)

[EnumerateRpsBeginResponse](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.EnumerateRpsBeginResponse)

### APDU

[Technical APDU Details](apdu/enum-rps-begin.md)
___

## Enumerate RPs get next RP

Get information about the next relying party (RP) represented by the credentials on the
YubiKey. This is one of the subcommands of the `authenticatorCredentialManagement`
command.

Not all YubiKeys support credential management. If you send this command to a YubiKey that
does not support it, the response will be "Unsupported option".

### Available

All YubiKeys with the FIDO2 application.

### SDK classes

[EnumerateRpsGetNextCommand](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.EnumerateRpsGetNextCommand)

[EnumerateRpsGetNextResponse](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.EnumerateRpsGetNextResponse)

### Input

### Output

The next RP on the YubiKey. The call to `EnumerateRpsBeginCommand` returned the first RP.
If there are more RPs, each successive call to `EnumerateRpsGetNextCommand` returns the
next one.

The data is returned in the form of a
[RelyingParty](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.RelyingParty) object.

### APDU

[Technical APDU Details](apdu/enum-rps-next.md)
___

## Get large blob

Get the large blob data out of the YubiKey. This command gets the raw data, it does not
perform any parsing or decoding.

Not all YubiKeys support large blobs. If you send this command to a YubiKey that does not
support it, the response will be "Unsupported extension".

### Available

All YubiKeys with the FIDO2 application.

### SDK classes

[GetLargeBlobCommand](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.GetLargeBlobCommand)

[GetLargeBlobResponse](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.GetLargeBlobResponse)

### Input

offset and count

Because a large blob can be bigger than the maximum message length, it is possible
retrieving the entire data will require more than one call. The offset specifies the
offset in the large blob data on the YubiKey where the returned data should begin. The
first call specifies an offset of zero, and each subsequent call specifies an offset of
the total number of bytes returned so far by each previous call.

The count is the number of bytes requested this call. This value must be less than or
equal to the "maximum fragment length". There is a maximum message size (specified by the
YubiKey and found in the `AuthenticatorInfo`) and the `MaxFragmentLength` is the
`MaxMessageSize - 64`.

### Output

The bytes the YubiKey was able to return. This is in the form of a `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`.
If the number of bytes returned is less than the count given, then there are no more bytes
to return. If the number is equal to the count, there could be more bytes on the YubiKey,
and the caller should send another command.

### APDU

[Technical APDU Details](apdu/get-large-blob.md)
___

## Set large blob

Store large blob data on the YubiKey. This command stores the data given, it does not
perform any encoding. This replaces any data currently in the large blob storage area on
the YubiKey.

Not all YubiKeys support large blobs. If you send this command to a YubiKey that does not
support it, the response will be "Unsupported extension".

### Available

All YubiKeys with the FIDO2 application.

### SDK classes

[SetLargeBlobCommand](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.SetLargeBlobCommand)

[SetLargeBlobResponse](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.SetLargeBlobResponse)

### Input

data to store, offset, count, PinUvAuthParam, PinProtocol

Because a large blob can be bigger than the maximum message length, it is possible storing
the entire data will require more than one call. The offset specifies the offset in the
large blob data on the YubiKey where the input data should be stored. The first call
specifies an offset of zero, and each subsequent call specifies an offset of the total
number of bytes stored so far by each previous call.

The count is the total number of bytes that will be stored. That is, it is the sum of all
the lengths of bytes stored by each call. The first time the set command is called, the
offset is zero and the count is the total number of bytes. Each subsequent call the offset
is where the previous call left off and the count is ignored.

Each block of input must be less than or equal to `maxFragmentLength` bytes
(`MaxMessageSize - 64`).

The caller need authorization to store, and obtains that by generating a PinUvAuthParam.

### Output

None

### APDU

[Technical APDU Details](apdu/set-large-blob.md)
___

## Reset

Reset the FIDO2 application on a YubiKey. This will delete all existing FIDO2 keys and
credentials, and remove the PIN.

It is not sufficient to simply execute this command in order to reset, it must be done
within a time limit of inserting a YubiKey and must be accompanied by a proof of user
presence (touch).

### Available

All YubiKeys with the FIDO2 application.

### SDK classes

[ResetCommand](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.ResetCommand)

[ResetResponse](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Fido2.Commands.ResetResponse)

### Input

None.

### Output

None

### APDU

[Technical APDU Details](apdu/reset.md)
___
