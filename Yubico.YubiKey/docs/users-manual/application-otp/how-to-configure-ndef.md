# How to configure NDEF to use a slot to generate an OTP

The [NDEF](xref:OtpNdef) (NFC Data Exchange Format) configuration for the OTP application is a special case. The NDEF
configuration is always active. If you present the YubiKey to an NFC reader and issue an NDEF read command, the YubiKey
will always emit something.

When you configure NDEF functionality, you are setting two things: some text and which OTP
configuration [slot](xref:OtpSlots) to use to generate a challenge. The text can be either a URI or just static text.

Unlike other configuration operations that take a slot identifier, configuring NDEF does not alter the configuration of
the OTP application slot. It only sets which slot to activate after sending the text.

In its default state, the YubiKey has NDEF configured to emit https://my.yubico.com/yk/# and then activate slot 1 (
the [short press](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot.ShortPress) slot), which is configured for Yubico OTP. The result looks
something like this: https://my.yubico.com/yk/#vvccccnnjfhbtdgbflcbfcegkkdvttldvlcvvfinvvdu.

> [!NOTE]
> YubiKey NEOs use a different URL: https://my.yubico.com/neo/?.

The most likely use case for this is to configure the YubiKey with a specific Yubico OTP credential and a URL to a
validation server.

NDEF should only be configured to work with a [Yubico OTP](xref:OtpYubicoOtp) or [HOTP](xref:OtpHotp) slot. Nothing will
prevent you from configuring NDEF to use a slot with any other configuration, but it will not emit anything useful.

For example, if a slot is configured for [challenge-response](xref:OtpChallengeResponse), presenting the YubiKey to an
NFC reader and issuing a NDEF read command will result in the static text or URI with nothing after. If a slot is
configured with a [static password](xref:OtpStaticPassword), the password will come through NDEF as the
raw [HID](xref:OtpHID) bytes, which are not recognizable as characters.
(Static passwords need to be communicated through a USB port using HID messages.)

## ConfigureNdef example

In this example, we will configure the [long-press](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot.LongPress) slot to emit an HOTP token,
and we will configure NDEF to emit an identifier for an example user.

To execute the code below, the YubiKey needs to either be inserted into a USB port or be on an NFC reader when the
command is run.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yKey))
{
  otp.ConfigureHotp(Slot.LongPress)
    .UseInitialMovingFactor(4096)
    .Use8Digits()
    .UseKey(_key)
    .Execute();
  otp.ConfigureNdef(Slot.LongPress)
    .AsText("AgentSmith:")
    .Execute();
}
```

After configuring NDEF with the code above, if you [read](xref:OtpReadNDEF) the YubiKey with an NFC reader, the result
will look something like `AgentSmith:00901250`.
