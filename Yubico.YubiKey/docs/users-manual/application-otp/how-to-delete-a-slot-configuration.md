# How to delete a slot's configuration

Deleting a [slot's](xref:OtpSlots) configuration removes all credentials, associated counters (if any), slot settings,
etc. To delete a slot's configuration, you must use one of two methods:

- [DeleteSlot()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.DeleteSlot%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29): for slots that are not
  configured with an access code.
- [DeleteSlotConfiguration()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.DeleteSlotConfiguration%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29):
  for slots that are configured with an access code.

> [!NOTE]
> These methods will fail if the slot you are attempting to delete is not configured.

## Examples

Before running any of the code provided below, make sure you have already connected to a particular YubiKey on your host
device via the [YubiKeyDevice](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.YubiKeyDevice) class.

To select the first available YubiKey connected to your host, use:

```C#
IEnumerable<IYubiKeyDevice> yubiKeyList = YubiKeyDevice.FindAll();

var yubiKey = yubiKeyList.First();
```

### Deleting a slot configuration when an access code is not present

To delete a slot configuration that is not protected with an access code,
use [DeleteSlot()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.DeleteSlot%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29). You cannot chain other
methods to ``DeleteSlot()``, including ``Execute()``. When calling ``DeleteSlot()``, just provide the slot field (in
this example, ``Slot.LongPress``).

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  otp.DeleteSlot(Slot.LongPress);
}
```

### Deleting a slot configuration when an access code is present

To delete a slot configuration that is protected with an access code, you must
call [DeleteSlotConfiguration](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.DeleteSlotConfiguration%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
and provide the current access code
with [UseCurrentAccessCode()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.OperationBase%601.UseCurrentAccessCode%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.SlotAccessCode%29).
You cannot set a new access code during this
operation--calling [SetNewAccessCode()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.OperationBase%601.SetNewAccessCode%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.SlotAccessCode%29)
will succeed, but the operation will not be applied.

Unlike ``DeleteSlot()``, ``DeleteSlotConfiguration()`` requires ``Execute()`` for the operation to apply the changes.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> currentAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, };
  SlotAccessCode currentAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(currentAccessCodeBytes);

  otp.DeleteSlotConfiguration(Slot.LongPress)
    .UseCurrentAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
    .Execute();
}
```
