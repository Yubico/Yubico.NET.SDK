# How to program a slot with an OATH HOTP credential

To configure a [slot](xref:OtpSlots) with an [OATH HOTP credential](xref:OtpHotp), you will use
a [ConfigureHotp](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp) instance. It is instantiated by calling the factory
method of the same
name ([ConfigureHotp()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.ConfigureHotp%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)) on
your [OtpSession](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession) instance.

The properties of the HOTP credential you wish to set are specified by calling their respective methods on
your ``ConfigureHotp`` instance.

## ConfigureHotp example

Before running any of the code provided below, make sure you have already connected to a particular YubiKey on your host
device via the [YubiKeyDevice](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.YubiKeyDevice) class.

To select the first available YubiKey connected to your host, use:

```C#
IEnumerable<IYubiKeyDevice> yubiKeyList = YubiKeyDevice.FindAll();

var yubiKey = yubiKeyList.First();
```

### Configure a slot with a provided secret key or a randomly generated key

When calling ``ConfigureHotp()``, you must either provide a secret key for the credential
with [UseKey()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.UseKey%28System.ReadOnlyMemory%7BSystem.Byte%7D%29) or
generate one randomly
with [GenerateKey()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.GenerateKey%28System.Memory%7BSystem.Byte%7D%29).
The keys must be equal to the length of [HmacKeySize](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.HmacKeySize) (20
bytes).

To configure the [LongPress](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot.LongPress) slot with an HOTP using a provided secret key (
which contains all 0s in this example), use:

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
    ReadOnlyMemory<byte> hmacKey = new byte[ConfigureHotp.HmacKeySize] {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, };

    otp.ConfigureHotp(Slot.LongPress)
       .UseKey(hmacKey)
       .Execute();
}    
```

To configure the ``LongPress`` slot with an HOTP using a randomly generated secret key, use:

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
    Memory<byte> hmacKey = new byte[ConfigureHotp.HmacKeySize];

    otp.ConfigureHotp(Slot.LongPress)
       .GenerateKey(hmacKey)
       .Execute();
}
```

The API does not own the object where secrets are stored. Therefore, you must still provide the place to put the
generated information (which is ``hmacKey`` in this example). Once you have done what is needed with the data, clear the
memory where it is located.

### Set the initial moving factor and/or generate 8-digit HOTPs

You may optionally set the initial moving factor (the counter)
with [UseInitialMovingFactor()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.UseInitialMovingFactor%28System.Int32%29).
If you do not call this method, the counter will be set to 0 by default.

> [!NOTE]  
> ``UseInitialMovingFactor()`` must be given an integer between 0 and 0xffff0 (1,048,560) that is divisible by 0x10 (
> 16), otherwise an exception will be thrown.

``ConfigureHotp()`` will configure a slot to generate 6-digit HOTPs by default. If you would like to generate 8-digit
HOTPs, you must call [Use8Digits()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.Use8Digits%28System.Boolean%29)
during configuration.

To set the initial moving factor to 16 and generate 8-digit HOTPs (with a randomly generated secret key), run the
following:

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
    Memory<byte> hmacKey = new byte[ConfigureHotp.HmacKeySize];

    otp.ConfigureHotp(Slot.LongPress)
       .UseInitialMovingFactor(16)
       .GenerateKey(hmacKey)
       .Use8Digits()
       .Execute();
}
```

## Slot reconfiguration and access codes

If a slot is protected by an access code and you wish to reconfigure it with an OATH HOTP credential, you must provide
that access code with ``UseCurrentAccessCode()`` during the ``ConfigureHotp()`` operation. Otherwise, the operation will
fail and throw the following exception:

```System.InvalidOperationException has been thrown. YubiKey Operation Failed. [Warning, state of non-volatile memory is unchanged.]```

For more information on slot access codes, please
see [How to set, reset, remove, and use slot access codes](xref:OtpSlotAccessCodes).

## Additional settings

The following additional (optional) settings can be applied during configuration:

- [AppendCarriageReturn()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.AppendCarriageReturn%28System.Boolean%29)
- [AppendDelayToFixed()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.AppendDelayToFixed%28System.Boolean%29)
- [AppendDelayToOtp()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.AppendDelayToOtp%28System.Boolean%29)
- [AppendTabToFixed()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.AppendTabToFixed%28System.Boolean%29)
- [SendReferenceString()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.SendReferenceString%28System.Boolean%29)
- [SendTabFirst()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.SendTabFirst%28System.Boolean%29)
- [SetAllowUpdate()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.SetAllowUpdate%28System.Boolean%29)
- [Use10msPacing()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.Use10msPacing%28System.Boolean%29)
- [Use20msPacing()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.Use20msPacing%28System.Boolean%29)
- [UseFastTrigger()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.UseFastTrigger%28System.Boolean%29)
- [UseNumericKeypad()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.ConfigureHotp.UseNumericKeypad%28System.Boolean%29)

The OATH HOTP does not have a fixed part, but you can still use ``AppendDelayToFixed()`` and ``AppendTabToFixed()``.
These will simply add a delay or send a tab prior to the HOTP, respectively.

With the exception of ``SendReferenceString()``, these settings can also be toggled after HOTP configuration by
calling [UpdateSlot()](xref:OtpUpdateSlot).

> [!NOTE]
> If you call ``SetAllowUpdate(false)`` during the inital configuration, you will not be able to update these settings
> with ``UpdateSlot()`` (the SDK will throw an exception). This can only be undone by reconfiguring the slot
> with ``ConfigureHotp()``. It is not necessary to call ``SetAllowUpdate(true)`` during configuration because updates are
> allowed by default.
