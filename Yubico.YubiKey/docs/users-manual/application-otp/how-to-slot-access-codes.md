# How to set, reset, remove, and use slot access codes

The YubiKey's OTP application [slots](xref:OtpSlots) can be protected by a six-byte access code. Once a slot is
configured with an access code, that slot cannot be reconfigured in any way unless the correct access code in provided
during the reconfiguration operation.

> [!NOTE]
> Attempting to perform an OTP application configuration operation without providing the correct access code will result
> in the following exception:
>
> ```System.InvalidOperationException has been thrown.```
> ```YubiKey Operation Failed. [Warning, state of non-volatile memory is unchanged.]```

So for example, let's say that the short press slot of a key was configured with a Yubico OTP credential and a slot
access code. If you want to reconfigure the slot with an OATH HOTP credential, you will have to provide the slot's
access code when calling ``ConfigureHotp()``.

Access codes can only be set, reset, or removed during another slot configuration operation:

- [ConfigureYubicoOtp()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.ConfigureYubicoOtp%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
- [ConfigureHotp()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.ConfigureHotp%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
- [ConfigureChallengeResponse()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.ConfigureChallengeResponse%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
- [ConfigureStaticPassword()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.ConfigureStaticPassword%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
- [UpdateSlot()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.UpdateSlot%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)

> [!NOTE]
> If a slot is configured with an access code,
> calling [ConfigureNdef()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.ConfigureNdef%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29) will fail,

## Slot access code properties

Access codes must be exactly six
bytes ([MaxAccessCodeLength](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength)).
The [SlotAccessCode](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.SlotAccessCode) container class pads the code with zeros (0x00) if less
than six bytes are provided and throws an exception if more than six bytes are provided.

If a slot is configured with an access code, that code must be specified during any reconfiguration operation. In
addition, if you donâ€™t also resupply the same (or any) code as a "new" access code, an access code will not be carried
over to the new slot configuration, and the slot will no longer be protected after reconfiguration.

## Example code

Before running any of the code provided below, make sure you have already connected to a particular YubiKey on your host
device via the [YubiKeyDevice](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.YubiKeyDevice) class.

To select the first available YubiKey connected to your host, use:

```C#
IEnumerable<IYubiKeyDevice> yubiKeyList = YubiKeyDevice.FindAll();

var yubiKey = yubiKeyList.First();
```

## Exampe: set a slot access code

To set a slot's access code when no access code is present,
call [SetNewAccessCode()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.OperationBase%601.SetNewAccessCode%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.SlotAccessCode%29)
during a slot configuration operation, and provide the access code as a ``SlotAccessCode`` object. Prior to the
configuration operation, initialize the ``SlotAccessCode`` object by passing it the access code
in ``ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`` form.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> hmacKey = new byte[ConfigureHotp.HmacKeySize] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, };

  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> accessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, };
  SlotAccessCode accessCode = new SlotAccessCode(accessCodeBytes);

  otp.ConfigureHotp(Slot.LongPress)
     .UseKey(hmacKey)
     .SetNewAccessCode(accessCode)
     .Execute();
}
```

## Example: reset a slot access code

To reset a slot's access code, you must provide the current access code
with [UseCurrentAccessCode()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.OperationBase%601.UseCurrentAccessCode%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.SlotAccessCode%29)
followed by the new access code with ``SetNewAccessCode()``:

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> hmacKey = new byte[ConfigureHotp.HmacKeySize] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, };

  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> currentAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, };
  SlotAccessCode currentAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(currentAccessCodeBytes);

  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> newAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, };
  SlotAccessCode newAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(newAccessCodeBytes);

  otp.ConfigureHotp(Slot.LongPress)
     .UseKey(hmacKey)
     .UseCurrentAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
     .SetNewAccessCode(newAccessCode)
     .Execute();
}
```

## Example: remove a slot access code

If you want to remove a slot's access code, you must either:

- provide a new access code of all zeros, or
- only call ``UseCurrentAccessCode()`` during the reconfiguration operation. The slot's access code will be removed if a
  code is not provided via ``SetNewAccessCode()`` after calling ``UseCurrentAccessCode()``.

> [!NOTE]
> A 6-byte access code of zeros (0x00) is considered no access code. The factory default state of the access code for
> each OTP slot is all zeros.

Once the access code is removed, you do not need to call ``UseCurrentAccessCode()`` with subsequent configuration
operations.

> [!NOTE]
> Technically, if a slot does not have an access code, you could provide any 6-byte code
> with ``UseCurrentAccessCode()``, and the operation would succeed.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> hmacKey = new byte[ConfigureHotp.HmacKeySize] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, };

  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> currentAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, };
  SlotAccessCode currentAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(currentAccessCodeBytes);

  // New access code of all zeros.
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> newAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, };
  SlotAccessCode newAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(newAccessCodeBytes);

  otp.ConfigureHotp(Slot.LongPress)
     .UseKey(hmacKey)
     .UseCurrentAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
     .SetNewAccessCode(newAccessCode)
     .Execute();
}
```

## Example: provide a slot access code during a configuration operation

Once a slot has been configured with an access code, you must provide that access code with ``UseCurrentAccessCode()``
when performing a configuration operation on that slot. To retain the access code, you must also
call ``SetNewAccessCode()``. If you do not call ``SetNewAccessCode()``, the access code will be removed.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> currentAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, };
  SlotAccessCode currentAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(currentAccessCodeBytes);

  Memory<byte> privateId = new byte[ConfigureYubicoOtp.PrivateIdentifierSize];
  Memory<byte> aesKey = new byte[ConfigureYubicoOtp.KeySize];

  otp.ConfigureYubicoOtp(Slot.LongPress)
     .UseCurrentAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
     .SetNewAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
     .UseSerialNumberAsPublicId()
     .GeneratePrivateId(privateId)
     .GenerateKey(aesKey)
     .Execute();
}
```

In this example, the slot is now configured with a Yubico OTP credential and is still protected by the same access
code (``currentAccessCode``).

## Deleting a slot configuration when an access code is present

To delete a slot configuration that is protected with an access code, you must
call [DeleteSlotConfiguration](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.DeleteSlotConfiguration%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
and provide the current access code with ``UseCurrentAccessCode()``. You cannot set a new access code during this
operation--calling ``SetNewAccessCode()`` will succeed, but the operation will not be applied.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> currentAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, };
  SlotAccessCode currentAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(currentAccessCodeBytes);

  otp.DeleteSlotConfiguration(Slot.LongPress)
     .UseCurrentAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
     .Execute();
}
```

To delete a slot configuration that is not protected with an access code,
use [DeleteSlot()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.DeleteSlot%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29).
