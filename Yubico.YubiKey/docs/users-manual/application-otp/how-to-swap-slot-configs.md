# How to swap slot configurations

Because swapping [slot](xref:OtpSlots) settings requires zero configuration, this operation is not designed as a Fluent
Builder operation. Itâ€™s as simple as calling the [SwapSlots](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.SwapSlots) method:

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yKey))
{
  otp.SwapSlots();
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> This method will fail if at least one of the slots is not currently configured. Also, if one or both of the slots is
> protected with an access code, this method will fail.
