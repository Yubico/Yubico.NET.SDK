# Slots

The OTP application on the YubiKey contains two configurable slots: the "long press" slot and the "short press" slot.
Each slot may be programmed with one of the following configurations:

- [Yubico OTP](xref:OtpYubicoOtp)
- [Initiative for Open Authentication HMAC-based OTP (OATH HOTP)](xref:OtpHotp)
- [Static password](xref:OtpStaticPassword)
- [Challenge-response (using the HMAC-SHA1 or Yubico OTP algorithms)](xref:OtpChallengeResponse)

## Slot activation

The slots are activated during authentication. Activation results in the generation and/or submission of a password or
challenge-response code from the YubiKey to the authenticating party through the use of
a [virtual keyboard](xref:OtpHID) (Yubico OTP, OATH HOTP, static password) or an API call (challenge-response). Only one
slot may be activated at a time.

Slots configured with a Yubico OTP, OATH HOTP, or static password are activated by touching the YubiKey. The duration of
touch determines which slot is used. The first slot ([ShortPress](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot.ShortPress) slot) is
activated when the YubiKey is touched for 1 - 2.5 seconds. The second
slot ([LongPress](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot.LongPress) slot) is activated when the YubiKey is touched for 3 - 5
seconds.

Challenge-response authentication is automatically initiated via an API call. However, challenge-response configurations
can be programmed to require a user to touch the YubiKey in order to validate user presence. In this case, the
cryptographic operation will be blocked until the YubiKey is touched (the duration of touch does not matter). If touch
is not required, the cryptographic operation will proceed automatically.

NFC-compatible YubiKeys also contain an [NDEF](xref:OtpNdef) tag that can be configured to point to one of the slots.
When the YubiKey is scanned by an NFC reader, the slot that is pointed to by the NDEF tag will activate, causing the
generation of an OTP.

> [!NOTE]
> NDEF tags only work with Yubico OTPs and OATH HOTPs.

## Slot properties

The OTP application slots have the following properties:

- Each slot may only be programmed with one configuration.
- Only one slot may be activated at a time.
- Slots can be [pointed to by an NDEF tag](xref:OtpConfigureNDEF).
- No data is shared between slots.
- Slots can be protected from reconfiguration with an [access code](xref:OtpSlotAccessCodes).
- Slot configurations can be [deleted](xref:OtpDeleteSlotConfig).
- Slot states can be [retrieved](xref:OtpRetrieveSlotStatus).
- Slot configurations can be [swapped](xref:OtpSwapSlot).
- Slot settings that aren't related to encryption can be [updated](xref:OtpUpdateSlot) without performing complete slot
  reconfiguration.
