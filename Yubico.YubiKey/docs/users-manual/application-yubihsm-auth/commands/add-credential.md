# Add credential

Store long-lived keys in the YubiHSM Auth application by creating a new [credential](xref:YubiHsmAuthCredential).

## Available

All YubiKeys with the YubiHSM Auth application (included in firmware version 5.4.3 and later).
> [!NOTE]
> Use the .NET
>
API's [HasFeature()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.YubiKeyFeatureExtensions.HasFeature%28Yubico.YubiKey.IYubiKeyDevice%2CYubico.YubiKey.YubiKeyFeature%29)
> method to check if a key has the YubiHSM Auth application.

## SDK classes

* AddCredentialCommand
* AddCredentialResponse

## Input

This operation requires authenticating with the management key. There is a limit of 8 attempts to authenticate with the
management key before the management key is blocked. Once the management key is blocked, the application itself must be
reset before authentication can be attempted again. To reset the application,
see [ResetApplicationCommand](xref:YubiHsmAuthCmdResetApplication). Supplying the correct management key before the
management key is blocked will reset the retry counter to 8.

The rest of the input data is related to the new credential:

* Label (64 bytes)
* Algorithm (1 byte)
* Keys (length depends on algorithm)
* Credential password (16 bytes)
* Touch policy (1 byte)

Further information is found in the [Data](#data) section.

> [!NOTE]
> The label may only contain characters that can be encoded with UTF-8, and its UTF-8 byte count must be between 1 and

64. Non-printing characters are allowed, as long as they can be encoded with UTF-8. For example, null (UTF-8: 0x00) and
    Right-To-Left Mark U+200F (UTF-8: 0xE2 0x80 0x8F) would be accepted. Since the label is used for display purposes,
    it is
    recommended to prefer printable characters.

## Output

None, though some information may be included in the status word when the command fails (
see [Response APDU](#response-apdu)).
