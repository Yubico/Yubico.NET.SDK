# List credentials

Get the public properties of all credentials present in the YubiHSM Auth application along with the number of retries
remaining for each.

## Available

All YubiKeys with the YubiHSM Auth application (included in firmware version 5.4.3 and later).
> [!NOTE]
> Use the .NET
> API's [HasFeature()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.YubiKeyFeatureExtensions.HasFeature%28Yubico.YubiKey.IYubiKeyDevice%2CYubico.YubiKey.YubiKeyFeature%29)
> method to check if a key has the YubiHSM Auth application.

## SDK classes

* [ListCredentialsCommand](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.YubiHsmAuth.Commands.ListCredentialsCommand)
* [ListCredentialsResponse](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.YubiHsmAuth.Commands.ListCredentialsResponse)

## Input

None.

## Output

A byte array formatted as a series of TLVs, where each element is a credential and its number of remaining retries. Each
element in the series begins with the Tag 0x72 (known as LabelList). The data is formatted in the following order:

| Order |        Meaning         | Size (bytes) |                                     Comments                                     |
|:-----:|:----------------------:|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   1   | Cryptographic key type |      1       | See [CryptographicKeyType](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.YubiHsmAuth.CryptographicKeyType) |
|   2   |     Touch required     |      1       |                                     Boolean                                      |
|   3   |         Label          |     1-64     |                                   ASCII string                                   |
|   4   |   Retries remaining    |      1       |                                 Positive integer                                 |

For example, for a YubiKey with two credentials stored in the YubiHSM Auth application, the response data (in
hexadecimal) might look like:

```text
Byte array: 72 07 26 00 61 62 63 00 04 72 08 26 01 77 78 79 7A 00 00

Notated:
72 07           Tag: LabelList, Length: 7
    26              Key type: AES-128
    00              Touch required: False
    61 62 63 00     Label: 'abc\0'
    04              Retries: 4
72 08           Tag: LabelList, Length: 8
    26              Key type: AES-128
    01              Touch required: True
    77 78 79 7A 00  Label: 'wxyz\0'
    00              Retries: 0
```
