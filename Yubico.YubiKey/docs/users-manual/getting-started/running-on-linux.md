# Running .NET SDK applications on Linux

Some special steps may be required to run applications that depend on the .NET
SDK on Linux.

## Distributions

### Officially supported

A distribution is officially supported after our team has run through our
acceptance tests on that distro. This is not the exhaustive suite of tests
for the SDK, but it's enough to give us confidence that the platform-specific
device discovery and communication logic are working properly. Any abnormalities
observed should be reported to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Yubico/Yubico.NET.SDK/issues).

At this time, the SDK has been tested to work on the following Linux distributions:

- Debian
- Ubuntu
- CentOS
- RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

### Other distros

There are plenty of popular distros that are *not* on this list. Though not officially supported,
there is a high likelihood that the SDK will still work on these distros. The instructions
below will likely be identical or very similar to what you will need to do to get started
with your distribution of choice.

## Dependencies

The .NET SDK depends on two main components for device communication: udev and pcsc-lite.

### PCSC-lite

PCSC-lite (referred to as PCSC for the remainder of this document) is a library used to
communicate with smart card readers and smart cards. Much of the YubiKey functionality
is exposed to an operating system as a smart card, so PCSC is likely critical for your
user to have installed. If you are planning to develop against the OATH, PIV, or OpenPGP
YubiKey applications, or you want to communicate with the YubiKey over NFC, you will
certainly need to have PCSC installed on the computer running your application.

PCSC can be installed in the following way:

```shell
# For APT based distros (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu):
sudo apt install pcscd

# For YUM based distros (e.g. RedHat, CentOS):
sudo yum install pcsc-lite
```

### UDev

UDev is a common Linux device manager available on most distributions. It is used to
discover PnP devices, from displays and sound cards to mice and keyboards. In the
case of the .NET SDK, UDev is used to discover the two HID devices exposed by the
YubiKey.

UDev should typically already be installed on your system. If it is not, that may
mean that your Linux distro uses an alternate device management system. Swapping
your current device manager with UDev is likely not a viable option and is not
recommended. If you are running a distro that is not running UDev and you are interested
in using this SDK, please open an issue on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Yubico/Yubico.NET.SDK/issues).
If there is broad interest, we will evaluate adding support to our roadmap.

#### Making sure the SDK can find UDev

As of SDK 1.4.0, the SDK P/Invokes UDev's shared library `libudev.so`. This library can have
multiple names (usually including a version number, e.g. `libudev.so.1`), so we target
the lowest common denominator name: `libudev`. As of .NET 7, the .NET library resolver is
not capable of automatically resolving the full path / name of this dependency.

As such, it will likely be required that you create a symbolic link from your shared
library directory, typically `/usr/lib`, to the real location of libudev.

For example:

```shell
# On Debian and Ubuntu, libraries are usually stored in an x86_64 subdirectory:
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/linux-x86_64/libudev.so.1 /usr/lib/libudev.so

# On CentOS and RHEL, libraries are usually stored in a lib64 subdirectory:
sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libudev.so.1 /usr/lib/libudev.so
```

Note that the exact file name and location may change based on your distribution and
the version of libudev installed.

### .NET and OpenSSL / libcrypto

Some distributions, like Ubuntu, have started to phase out older versions of
OpenSSL, making OpenSSL 3.x its default. Older .NET versions such as .NET Core 3.1
do not support this and require older versions of OpenSSL. Be aware that .NET
itself may have dependencies like this, and the choice of framework version
may have further impact for your application's stated dependencies.

Although the SDK supports any .NET implementation of .NET Standard 2.0, it is
recommended that .NET 6.x be your minimum target. This is a long-term support release
of .NET and has the needed support for the newer versions of OpenSSL. It also
includes quite a few general improvements to the Linux experience.
