                // There are a number of ways to resolve this. Here are two.
                // One, just call the KeyCollector with a Request of Touch
                // because the probability of a quick error is very small. In the
                // unlikely case there is an error, we will quickly call the
                // KeyCollector again with a Request of Release. Furthermore, the
                // call to the Reset command returns an error code so that the
                // caller has enough information to inform the user that there
                // was an error and touch is not needed after all.
                // Two, create a separate thread with the call to the
                // KeyCollector, but delay the call (e.g. Thread.Sleep) to give
                // the Reset command some time to determine if there's an error.
                // This might work, but the length of time to wait is dependent
                // on the specific chip's speed, how fast the platform can
                // communicate with a YubiKey, and the order of operations
                // executed in each thread. Hence, in some situations, it is
                // possible that despite the delay, the KeyCollector is called
                // even when there is a Reset error.

                // This sample code will use the first option.

                // On a separate thread, call the KeyCollector to announce we
                // need touch.
                // Generally we don't call the KeyCollector on another thread,
                // but for touch, we don't know for sure whether the KeyCollector
                // is going to return immediately or not. For example, a
                // KeyCollector might create a window with a message for touch
                // that also includes an OK button. Until that button is clicked,
