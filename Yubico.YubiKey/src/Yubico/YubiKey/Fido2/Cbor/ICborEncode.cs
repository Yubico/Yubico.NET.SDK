    /// This is generally used to write out an encoded value for the
    /// <c>CborWriter.WriteEncodedValue</c> method. For example, suppose we need
    /// to write out a CBOR-encoded key as part of a larger CBOR encoding. We
    /// already have the <see cref="CoseKey"/> class which can encode the key. So
    /// we don't need to write the encode code again, we just need to get the
    /// encoding from the object. The resulting encoding can then be copied into
    /// the CBOR structure. An alternative is to get the encoding from the key
    /// object and pass it into the CborHelper, but then we need to know if this
    /// is encoded or a byte string, and there's the Nullable to deal with. So
    /// just implement this interface to indicate that we have an object that can
    /// encode itself and to take the output of that encoding and simply copy it
    /// into the full structure.
