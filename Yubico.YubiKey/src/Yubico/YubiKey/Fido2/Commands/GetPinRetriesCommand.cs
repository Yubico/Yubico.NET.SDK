    /// When verifying a FIDO2 PIN, it is possible that the user will incorrectly type it in and it will fail. Fail
    /// enough times in a row, and the YubiKey may block further authentication attempts. Once this has happened, the
    /// YubiKey FIDO application must be reset - resulting in the loss of all FIDO credentials.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// While this may seem catastrophic, it is actually a valuable protection mechanism against attackers guessing at
    /// the YubiKey's PIN. The range of possible PINs far exceeds the limited number of guesses available to the user.
    /// By locking out the FIDO application, an attacker is denied the opportunity of unlimited guessing.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// For non-malicious cases, where a user simply mistyped their PIN, the user will likely never exhaust the number
    /// of allowed retries. This is because the retry counter is reset to the configured number of retries once a valid
    /// PIN has been entered. For example: If the retry counter started with 8 retries and you enter in 4 false guesses,
    /// the retry counter will be reset to 8 if you enter the correct PIN on the 5th retry.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// The number of allowable retries is configurable, and may differ between YubiKeys. By default, it is set to 8
    /// retries. This command will return the current number of remaining retries for this particular YubiKey. Use the

    /// retries remaining.
