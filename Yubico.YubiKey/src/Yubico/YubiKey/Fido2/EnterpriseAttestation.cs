    /// > enterprise context is in effect when a device, e.g., a computer, an
    /// > authenticator, etc., is controlled by an enterprise.

    /// > An enterprise attestation is an attestation that may include uniquely
    /// > identifying information. This is intended for controlled deployments
    /// > within an enterprise where the organization wishes to tie registrations
    /// > to specific authenticators.
    /// >
    /// > The expectation is that enterprises will work directly with their
    /// > authenticator vendor(s) in order to source their enterprise attestation
    /// > capable authenticators.
