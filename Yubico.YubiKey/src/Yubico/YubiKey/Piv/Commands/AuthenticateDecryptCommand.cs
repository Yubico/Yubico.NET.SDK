    /// In the PIV standard, there is a command called GENERAL AUTHENTICATE.
    /// Although it is one command, it can do four things: authenticate a
    /// management key (challenge-response), sign arbitrary data, RSA decryption,
    /// and EC Diffie-Hellman. The SDK breaks these four operations into separate
    /// classes. This class is how you perform "GENERAL AUTHENTICATE: RSA
    /// Decryption".
    /// <para>
    /// The partner Response class is <see cref="AuthenticateDecryptResponse"/>.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Use this Command class only if the slot selected holds an RSA private
    /// key. If the private key in a slot called upon to perform this command is
    /// ECC, the YubiKey will return an error. While there is an algorithm known
    /// as "EC Encryption Scheme" (aka "EC El Gamal"), the YubiKey does not
    /// support it. Hence, this command will not be able to decrypt using an EC
    /// key. Therefore, you should know which algorithm (and size) the key in the
    /// requested slot is before calling on this class.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// In order to decrypt, it is possible you must verify the PIN. The PIN is
    /// not part of this command. For information on how to verify a PIN in order

    /// management" slot, but any PIV slot that holds a private key, other then
    /// <c>F9</c>, will be able to decrypt (as long as it contains an RSA private
    /// key). That is, any PIV slot other than <c>80</c>, <c>81</c>, <c>9B</c>,
    /// or <c>F9</c> will be able to decrypt. Note that slot <c>F9</c> contains
    /// the attestation key, which will sign a certificate it creates, but it
    /// cannot decrypt.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// The caller supplies the data to decrypt. It must be a block the same size
    /// as the key. For an RSA-1024 key, the block must be 128 bytes, for an
    /// RSA-2048 key, the block must be 256 bytes. If the actual data to decrypt
    /// is shorter, it must be provided with as many prepended 00 bytes as needed
    /// to make sure the block is the appropriate length.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
