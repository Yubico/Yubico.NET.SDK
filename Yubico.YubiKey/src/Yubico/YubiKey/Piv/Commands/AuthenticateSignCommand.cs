    /// In the PIV standard, there is a command called GENERAL AUTHENTICATE.
    /// Although it is one command, it can do four things: authenticate a
    /// management key (challenge-response), sign arbitrary data, RSA decryption,
    /// and EC Diffie-Hellman. The SDK breaks these four operations into separate
    /// classes. This class is how you perform "GENERAL AUTHENTICATE: Sign".

    /// signature" slot, but any PIV slot that holds a private key, other then
    /// <c>F9</c>, will be able to create a signature. That is, any PIV slot
    /// other than <c>80</c>, <c>81</c>, <c>9B</c>, or <c>F9</c> will be able to
    /// sign. Note that slot <c>F9</c> contains the attestation key, which will
