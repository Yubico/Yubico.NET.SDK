    /// Some operations require the user enter a PIN. Use this class to build a

    /// The PIN starts out as a default value: "123456", which in ASCII is the
    /// 6-byte sequence <c>0x31 32 33 34 35 36</c>. Generally, the first thing
    /// done when a YubiKey is initialized for PIV is to change the PIN (along
    /// with the PUK and management key). The PIN must be 6 to 8 bytes.
    /// Ultimately the bytes that make up the PIN can be any binary value, but
    /// are generally input from a keyboard, so are usually made up of ASCII
    /// characters.
