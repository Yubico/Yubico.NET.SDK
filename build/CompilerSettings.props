        Use C# 8.0 features. This is likely the maximum language version that we can use while generating
        .NETStandard 2.0 libraries. C# 9.0 requires the .NET 5 runtime. More research can be done at the time
        of .NET 5 release to re-evaluate this statement.

        Enable nullable reference types. This is a C# 8.0 feature that is off by default, due to backward
        compatability reasons. Since this is a brand new project starting, we do not have this concern and should
        use the new behavior.
    
        Nullable reference types allow us to have nearly identical behavior to nullable value types. This allows
        code maintainers to reason about null behavior in a much more consistent way.

        We want to treat all warnings as errors. While most of this behavior is now controlled by .editorconfig
        files, we still set this globally in case any error groups were missed.
    
        Warnings contribute to technical debt of the project. Forcing us to deal with warnings in the here and
        now helps prevent any future build-up. Likewise, updating to new compilers or analyzers should be done
        deliberately. If any new errors or warnings are introduced as part of the upgrade, they should be
        addressed as part of that commit.

        Create byte-for-byte identical build artifacts given the same build input. Normally, the compiler will
        add certain things to the binary header like timestamp, compiler version, and even more seemingly
        unnecessary administrivia. There doesn't really seem to be any benefit to this, and arguable deterministic
        builds should be the default; but they aren't. Setting this can potentially open the door to build caching,
        better build auditing, and faster testing.
