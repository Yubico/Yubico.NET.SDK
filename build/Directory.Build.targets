  Directory.Build.targets

  This file is the root of all post-project build settings and targets. It is evaluated _after_ the
  csproj file. Properties and item groups in the csproj should be visible here, however any variables
  set here will not have any effect on conditions in the csproj as they will have already been evaluated.
