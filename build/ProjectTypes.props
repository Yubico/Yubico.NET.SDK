  ProjectTypes.props

  This file contains properties that attempt to classify projects as being of a certain type.
  The project types currently defined are:
  - Production: Any project that compiles to a binary that is shipped as part of the final
                product.
  - Test:       Any project that is used to test production code. This could include unit tests,
                integration tests, or scenario tests. Test tools are not included in this project
                type. Only projects that need to link against a test framework should fall into
                this bucket.
  - Reference:  A special metadata only project type used by Visual Studio and Intellisense for
                resolving types contained within a multi-targeted assembly. This blog post by
                MSBuild developer Claire Novotny explains why and when reference assemblies are
                used: https://claires.site/2018/07/03/create-and-pack-reference-assemblies/.

    A project is a test project if it it ends with Tests in the project name. For example:
    MyProject.UnitTests.csproj will pick up this property. MyProject.UnitTest.csproj will not.
    The filename convention is case Insensitive.

    <!--
    A project is a reference assembly project if it ends with Ref in the project name. For
    example: MyProject.Ref.csproj will pick up this property. The filename convention is case
    insensitive.

    A project is a production project if it does not end in any of the other special suffixes handled
    previously.
