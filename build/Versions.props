Versions.props

A centralized place to configure the versions assigned to assemblies built by this repository. All
versions should be referenced from this file - do not manually set properties of a project elsewhere.

Versions should follow the semver 2.0 specification. Projects can and should adjust their revisions
independently. See each specific project's version property for further guidance.

Projects can use the pre-release suffixes alpha and preview, followed by an incremented number to denote
working versions prior to a major or minor release. Note that if the previous version was 1.1.0, the
next pre-release version would be 1.2.0-alpha.1. Alpha is used for internal milestones, preview is used
for external milestones.
