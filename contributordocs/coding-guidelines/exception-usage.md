# Exception usage

Exceptions are the mechanism for relaying error information throughout the .NET platform and in languages
such as C#.

> Applications must be able to handle errors that occur during execution in a consistent manner. .NET provides
> a model for notifying applications of errors in a uniform way: .NET operations indicate failure by throwing
> exceptions.
>
> [Handling and throwing exceptions in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/exceptions/)

## Prerequisites

This page is not meant to be an exhaustive reference on exception behavior and design. The expectation is that
you have read through the following pages and have a grasp of the fundamentals of exceptions in .NET.

1. [Handling and throwing exceptions in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/exceptions/)
2. [Best Practices for exceptions - .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/exceptions/best-practices-for-exceptions)
3. [Exceptions and Exception Handling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/)
4. [Using Exceptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/using-exceptions)
5. [Creating and Throwing Exceptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/creating-and-throwing-exceptions)
6. [How to execute cleanup code using finally](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/how-to-execute-cleanup-code-using-finally)

Instead, this guide will aim to be a quick reference guide for how exceptions can be used effectively and
efficiently within the SDK project.

## Using exceptions

Your *default* mindset should be: If I can’t reasonably handle a problem in the immediate scope of the function,
I should **throw an exception**!

The rest of this section will go into details about the specifics on how you should use exceptions.

### Why use exceptions?

- Can provide rich information to the caller
- Errors cannot be ignored
- Uniform type tree, no colliding numberings or different encoding schemes (POSIX vs. Win32 vs. HRESULT, etc.)
- Happy paths and error paths are explicitly defined
- Developer expectations: It is how .NET does things
- Debugger will automatically break on exceptions

### Error condition? or program flow?

> Don't use exceptions to change the flow of a program as part of ordinary execution. Use exceptions to report
> and handle error conditions.
>
> [Creating and Throwing Exceptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/creating-and-throwing-exceptions#things-to-avoid-when-throwing-exceptions)

In some cases, it is extremely clear when something is an error condition (argument is null) and when it is control
flow (last item of an array encountered while looping). Many times it is not.

One very important distinction here is to understand what the above quote is not saying. It is not saying that you
should never catch and respond to error conditions.

### Exceptional conditions

It is impossible to enumerate all possible exception conditions, or even classifications of exception conditions.
This list represents the exceptions that have been encountered by the SDK thus far, and how many times they appear.
The number of appearances is a very rough measurement and is used here to aid readability of the table. How many
times an exception type appears should not be used to justify the selection/use of an exception type.
