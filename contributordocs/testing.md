# Testing

## Unit Tests

Project: `Yubico.YubiKey.UnitTests`

## Integration Tests

Project: `Yubico.YubiKey.IntegrationTests`

### Standard Test Devices

To make integration testing easier across the team, we have standardized the set of YubiKeys used in integration
testing. These devices are enumerated in `Yubico.YubiKey.TestUtilities.StandardTestDevice`. As of April 26, 2021, these
test devices are:

- Fw3
    - Major version 3, USB A keychain, not FIPS
- Fw4Fips
    - Major version 4, USB A keychain, FIPS
- Fw5
    - Major version 5, USB A keychain, not FIPS
- Fw5Fips
    - Major version 5, USB A keychain, FIPS
- Fw5ci
    - Major version 5, USB C Lightning, not FIPS

### Selecting Test Devices

The set of all available test devices can be retrieved
using `Yubico.YubiKey.TestUtilities.IntegrationTestDeviceEnumeration`

To run a test against a specific test device, you can use `Yubico.YubiKey.TestUtilities.TestDeviceSelection` For
example, `SelectRequiredTestDevice(StandardTestDevice)` will find the first valid device in a set of `IYubiKey` objects.
If it cannot find a valid device, it throws an exception.

```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData(StandardTestDevice.Fw5)]
[InlineData(StandardTestDevice.Fw5Fips)]
public void SetDeviceInfo_NoData_ResponseStatusSuccess(StandardTestDevice testDeviceType)
{
    IYubiKey testDevice =
        IntegrationTestDeviceEnumeration.GetTestDevices()
        .SelectRequiredTestDevice(testDeviceType);

    using IYubiKeyConnection connection = testDevice.Connect(YubiKeyApplication.Management);

    var setCommand = new SetDeviceInfoCommand();

    YubiKeyResponse setDeviceInfoResponse = connection.SendCommand(setCommand);
    Assert.Equal(ResponseStatus.Success, setDeviceInfoResponse.Status);
}
```
