# ISA — Session Contention

## The problem in three lines

```csharp
await using var piv = await key.CreatePivSessionAsync();  // CCID handle #1, SELECT PIV
await piv.VerifyPinAsync(pin);                            // security state established
var info = await key.GetDeviceInfoAsync();                // CCID handle #2, SELECT Management
                                                          //   -> PIV deselected, PIN destroyed
await piv.SignAsync(...);                                 // expected failure
```

Ordinary public API, default settings, one process, no exotic conditions. `GetDeviceInfoAsync`
is a plain read whose default transport order puts SmartCard first, so it takes CCID and issues
`SELECT Management`. On the card's basic logical channel that deselects PIV and destroys the
verified-PIN state.

## Why it exists

`DeviceConnectionRegistry` excludes **discovery** from everything and excludes **sessions** from
nothing. Session leases are ref-counted (N sessions coexist); the discovery lease is exclusive.
Two in-process sessions on one interface get two `SCardConnect` handles and two protocol
instances, so the per-protocol `AsyncExchangeGate` does not serialize them.

The registry was built for the single-interface, PIV-shaped world where discovery is the only
other actor. Multi-interface applets — Management (`[SmartCard, HidFido, HidOtp]`), YubiOTP,
FIDO2 — arrived afterwards. The registry's docs are explicit about the **process** boundary and
silent about the **session-vs-session** boundary, which is exactly where the hazard lives.

**Discovery is the existence proof.** Discovery reads also issue `SELECT Management`; the
exclusive discovery lease exists precisely because someone hit this. The fix never generalized
to sessions.

## Ideal State Criteria

| ISC | Criterion | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| ISC-1 | The three-line sequence cannot silently destroy session state. It either succeeds, or fails loudly with an error naming the current holder. | Hardware integration test |
| ISC-2 | Every P1/P2 row of the edge-case register is covered by a passing test, or is a documented bound with a pinning test that asserts the bounded behaviour. | Register → test-ID mapping, mechanically checked |
| ISC-3 | The session-vs-session boundary is a **named concept** enforced in one place, not a test convention. | The convention comment is deleted and replaced by a contract test |
| ISC-4 | No regression: 5 hardware discovery invariants, `PivMultiKeyContentionTests` 2/2, resilience 69/69, full Core suite, `dotnet format` clean. | Standing gates, every phase |
| ISC-5 | No material performance regression in scan latency or session-open latency against a baseline captured before any change. | `merge-diag` before/after |
| ISC-6 | Management transport tests genuinely exercise the transport they name. | A HID-pinned session must throw `NotSupportedException` from `ResetDeviceAsync`; SmartCard must not |
| ISC-7 | Every production behaviour change is backed by a test that failed **for its predicted reason** before the change. | RED output recorded verbatim in this ISA |
| ISC-8 | `DeviceId` has one stated contract, and no component contradicts it. | `YubiKeyDeviceRepository` and `FindYubiKeys` agree; contract documented |

## Non-goals

- Cross-process contention. The registry is in-process **by contract**; this effort does not change that.
- Logical-channel multiplexing. If two applet sessions genuinely need to coexist on one CCID
  interface, that is a separate design effort. Until someone demonstrates the need, a named loud
  error is the correct answer.
- Reworking `AsyncExchangeGate`, `DisposalGate`, single-flight reads, or worker admission. These
  are different layers and are load-bearing for reasons unrelated to this problem.
- The composite merge algorithm. Landed separately in PR #543.

## Abort criteria

Stop and re-plan rather than pushing through if any of these hold:

1. The fix requires a **public API redesign** rather than a behavioural correction.
2. The register exceeds roughly **30 P1/P2 rows** — the problem is bigger than scoped and needs
   splitting.
3. **Three DevTeam loops** close on one phase without convergence.
4. A hardware experiment shows the hazard is a **device/firmware** behaviour the SDK cannot
   correct, in which case the deliverable becomes documentation plus a loud failure, not a fix.

## Evidence rules

Inherited from the composite-merge effort and binding here:

- Defect fixes require **RED for the predicted reason**. A test that merely fails is not evidence;
  it must fail in the way the hypothesis states.
- Invariant pins may pass before the change and **never** count as fix evidence.
- Probabilistic or timing-sensitive changes require a diagnostics delta, not a single green run.
- Concurrency assertions run **at least 10 iterations**. A single intermittent red is a finding to
  investigate, never a rerun-until-green.

## Shipping decision

Behaviour change, no compatibility switch. The package is `2.0.0-preview.X`, which is the correct
window to fix a contract that silently destroys authentication state. The pinned test asserting
that two session leases succeed is **reclassified** — it proves lease *acquisition* is
ref-counted, not that concurrent applet sessions are *supported*. Two independent reviews reached
that reading separately.

## Residual — not covered by this effort

All hardware evidence here is **macOS**, on a two-key same-PID rig (serials 103 and 125, both
firmware 5.8.0, PID 0x0407).

- **Linux** — udev and PC/SC paths unverified.
- **Windows** — PC/SC sharing semantics, and the platform-divergent HID open behaviour
  (macOS seizes HID FIDO IO reports; Windows and Linux share) unverified.

These require dedicated hardware on those platforms and are tracked as followups, alongside the
existing Windows topology Tier 2 gap from the composite-merge effort. Coverage claims in this
document are macOS-scoped unless stated otherwise.
