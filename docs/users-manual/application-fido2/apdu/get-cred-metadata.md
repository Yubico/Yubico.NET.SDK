## Get credential metadata

### Command APDU info

 | CLA | INS | P1 | P2 |      Lc       |       Data        |    Le    |
 |:---:|:---:|:--:|:--:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:--------:| 
 | 00  | 10  | 00 | 00 | *data length* | 0A *encoded info* | (absent) |

The Ins byte (instruction) is 10, which is the byte for CTAPHID_CBOR.
That means the command information is in a CBOR encoded structure in the
Data.

The data consists of the CTAP Command Byte and the CBOR encoding of the
command's parameters. In this case, the CTAP Command Byte is `0A`,
which is the command "`authenticatorCredentialManagement`". The CBOR
encoding is

```txt
  A3
     01 --int-- subcommand = 01
     03 --int-- protocol
     04 --byte string-- PinUvAuthParam
```

### Response APDU info

#### Response APDU for a successful get

Total Length: *variable + 2*\
Data Length: *variable*

|      Data      | SW1 | SW2 |
|:--------------:|:---:|:---:|
| *encoded info* | 90  | 00  |

The info returned is CBOR encoded. It has a structure similar to the
following.

```txt
  A2
     01 --int--
     02 --int--
```
