# How to back up credentials

Secrets on a YubiKey are, by design, write-only objects. This means that the shared secrets stored in the YubiKey can
only be written into, and not read out, of the device. If a credential is to be copied, it must be known beforehand and
either written down or copied before programming the YubiKey.

It is not possible to create an exact copy of a YubiKey. It is possible to duplicate the credentials stored on the
YubiKey if that credential was first generated outside of the YubiKey. When you add a credential, be sure you copy the
shared secret key for that credential and store it in a safe place.

The best ways to back up credentials are:

- Add credentials at the same time to multiple YubiKeys if you have them.
- Or save a copy of the QR code (capture the screen) or make a copy of the shared secret key and place them in secure
  storage until needed again.

Otherwise, if you add credentials to one YubiKey and then later decide to buy another YubiKey for a backup, you must log
into every account and go through the setup process again. To get a new credential for each account, delete the original
credentials from the original YubiKey, and then add the new credentials to both YubiKeys.
