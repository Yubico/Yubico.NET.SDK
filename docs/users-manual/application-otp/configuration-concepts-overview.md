# Configuration concepts

The articles in this section cover the four OTP application configurations, as well as
the [NDEF (NFC Data Exchange Format) tag](xref:OtpNdef):

- [Yubico OTP](xref:OtpYubicoOtp)
- [Initiative for Open Authentication HMAC-based OTP (OATH HOTP)](xref:OtpHotp)
- [Static password](xref:OtpStaticPassword)
- [Challenge-response (using the HMAC-SHA1 or Yubico OTP algorithms)](xref:OtpChallengeResponse)

The purpose of these articles is to convey the following information:

- what each configuration is and how it works
- YubiKey nuances related to each configuration
- an overview of the SDK functionality in each area
- intended applications and limitations of each configuration

These articles build on the topics discussed in the [OTP application concepts section](xref:OtpAppConcepts). You may
find it helpful to refer back to that section as you develop an understanding of the configurations.
