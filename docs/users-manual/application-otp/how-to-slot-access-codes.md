# How to set, modify, remove, and use slot access codes

The YubiKey's OTP application [slots](xref:OtpSlots) can be protected by a six-byte access code. Once a slot is
configured with an access code, that slot cannot be reconfigured in any way unless the correct access code is provided
during the reconfiguration operation.

Attempting to perform a slot configuration operation without providing the correct access code will result
in the following exception:

```System.InvalidOperationException has been thrown.```
```YubiKey Operation Failed. [Warning, state of non-volatile memory is unchanged.]```

## Slot access code properties

Access codes can only be set, modified, or removed during one of the following slot configuration operations:

- [ConfigureYubicoOtp()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.ConfigureYubicoOtp%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
- [ConfigureHotp()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.ConfigureHotp%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
- [ConfigureChallengeResponse()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.ConfigureChallengeResponse%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
- [ConfigureStaticPassword()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.ConfigureStaticPassword%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
- [UpdateSlot()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.UpdateSlot%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)

Therefore, the **only** way to modify a slot access code that doesn't result in the reconfiguration of the slot's current cryptographic credential is to use ``UpdateSlot()``. However, calling ``UpdateSlot()`` will revert a number of other slot settings (such as ``SetAppendCarriageReturn()``) to their default states unless otherwise specified during the operation. See [How to update slot settings](xref:OtpUpdateSlot) for more information.

Access codes must be exactly six
bytes ([MaxAccessCodeLength](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength)).
The [SlotAccessCode](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.SlotAccessCode) container class pads the code with zeros (0x00) if less
than six bytes are provided and throws an exception if more than six bytes are provided.

If a slot is configured with an access code, that code must be specified during any reconfiguration operation. In
addition, if you donâ€™t resupply the same (or any) code as a "new" access code, an access code will not be carried
over to the new slot configuration, and the slot will no longer be protected after reconfiguration.

If a slot is protected by an access code, deleting the slot's configuration requires the use of the compatible [DeleteSlotConfiguration](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.DeleteSlotConfiguration%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29) method.

## Example code

Before running any of the code provided below, make sure you have already connected to a particular YubiKey on your host
device via the [YubiKeyDevice](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.YubiKeyDevice) class.

To select the first available YubiKey connected to your host, use:

```C#
IEnumerable<IYubiKeyDevice> yubiKeyList = YubiKeyDevice.FindAll();

var yubiKey = yubiKeyList.First();
```

### Example: set a slot access code

To set a slot's access code when no access code is present,
call [SetNewAccessCode()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.OperationBase%601.SetNewAccessCode%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.SlotAccessCode%29)
during a slot configuration operation, and provide the access code as a ``SlotAccessCode`` object. Prior to the
configuration operation, initialize the ``SlotAccessCode`` object by passing it the access code
in ``ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`` form.

In this example, we are setting a new access code while configuring the long press slot with a new HOTP credential.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  // example HOTP key
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> hmacKey = new byte[ConfigureHotp.HmacKeySize] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, };

  // example slot access code
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> accessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, };
  SlotAccessCode accessCode = new SlotAccessCode(accessCodeBytes);

  otp.ConfigureHotp(Slot.LongPress)
     .UseKey(hmacKey)
     .SetNewAccessCode(accessCode)
     .Execute();
}
```

### Example: modify a slot access code

To modify a slot's access code, you must provide the current access code
with [UseCurrentAccessCode()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Operations.OperationBase%601.UseCurrentAccessCode%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.SlotAccessCode%29)
followed by the new access code with ``SetNewAccessCode()`` during a slot configuration operation.

In this example, we are reconfiguring the long press slot with a new access code via the ``UpdateSlot()`` method. ``UpdateSlot()`` will not modify the slot's cryptographic configuration. However, it will revert a number of other slot settings (such as ``SetAppendCarriageReturn()``) to their default states unless otherwise specified during the operation.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  // Example current slot access code.
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> currentAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01, };
  SlotAccessCode currentAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(currentAccessCodeBytes);

  // Example new slot access code.
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> newAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, };
  SlotAccessCode newAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(newAccessCodeBytes);

  otp.UpdateSlot(Slot.LongPress)
     .UseCurrentAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
     .SetNewAccessCode(newAccessCode)
     .Execute();
}
```

### Example: remove a slot access code

If you want to remove a slot's access code during a configuration operation, you can either:

- provide a new access code of all zeros with ``SetNewAccessCode()``, or
- skip the ``SetNewAccessCode()`` call entirely

> [!NOTE]
> A 6-byte access code of zeros (0x00) is the factory default state for each OTP slot.

Once the access code is removed, you do not need to call ``UseCurrentAccessCode()`` with subsequent configuration
operations.

In this example, we are effectively removing the access code from the long press slot by providing a new code of all zeros during the ``UpdateSlot()`` operation. ``UpdateSlot()`` will not modify the slot's cryptographic configuration. However, it will revert a number of other slot settings (such as ``SetAppendCarriageReturn()``) to their default states unless otherwise specified during the operation.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  // Example current access code.
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> currentAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, };
  SlotAccessCode currentAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(currentAccessCodeBytes);

  // New access code of all zeros.
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> newAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, };
  SlotAccessCode newAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(newAccessCodeBytes);

  otp.UpdateSlot(Slot.LongPress)
     .UseCurrentAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
     .SetNewAccessCode(newAccessCode)
     .Execute();
}
```

### Example: provide a slot access code during a configuration operation

Once a slot has been configured with an access code, you must provide that access code with ``UseCurrentAccessCode()``
when performing a configuration operation on that slot. To retain the access code, you must also
call ``SetNewAccessCode()`` and provide the same access code. If you do not call ``SetNewAccessCode()``, the access code will be removed.

> [!NOTE]
> If a slot does not have an access code, providing any 6-byte code
> with ``UseCurrentAccessCode()`` during a configuration operation will succeed.

In this example, we are reconfiguring an access code-protected long press slot with a new Yubico OTP credential. The access code is carried over to the new slot configuration by the ``SetNewAccessCode(currentAccessCode)`` call.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  // Example current access code.
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> currentAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, };
  SlotAccessCode currentAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(currentAccessCodeBytes);

  Memory<byte> privateId = new byte[ConfigureYubicoOtp.PrivateIdentifierSize];
  Memory<byte> aesKey = new byte[ConfigureYubicoOtp.KeySize];

  otp.ConfigureYubicoOtp(Slot.LongPress)
     .UseCurrentAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
     .SetNewAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
     .UseSerialNumberAsPublicId()
     .GeneratePrivateId(privateId)
     .GenerateKey(aesKey)
     .Execute();
}
```

### Example: deleting a slot configuration when an access code is present

To delete a slot configuration that is protected with an access code, you must
call [DeleteSlotConfiguration](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.DeleteSlotConfiguration%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29)
and provide the current access code with ``UseCurrentAccessCode()``.

You cannot set a new access code during this
operation. The ``DeleteSlotConfiguration`` operation will still succeed if you call ``SetNewAccessCode()``, but the new access code will not be applied.

```C#
using (OtpSession otp = new OtpSession(yubiKey))
{
  // Example current access code.
  ReadOnlyMemory<byte> currentAccessCodeBytes = new byte[SlotAccessCode.MaxAccessCodeLength] { 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, 0x02, };
  SlotAccessCode currentAccessCode = new SlotAccessCode(currentAccessCodeBytes);

  otp.DeleteSlotConfiguration(Slot.LongPress)
     .UseCurrentAccessCode(currentAccessCode)
     .Execute();
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> To delete a slot configuration that is not protected with an access code,
use [DeleteSlot()](xref:Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.OtpSession.DeleteSlot%28Yubico.YubiKey.Otp.Slot%29).
