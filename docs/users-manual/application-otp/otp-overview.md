# OTP application overview

The OTP application on the YubiKey allows developers to program the device with a variety of configurations through
two "[slots](xref:OtpSlots)." Each slot may be programmed with a single configuration — no data is shared between slots,
and each slot may be protected with an [access code](xref:OtpSlotAccessCodes) to prevent modification.

"OTP application" is a bit of a misnomer. While OTP (one-time password) functionality is the focus of the application,
the slots may be programmed with other configurations. Supported configurations include:

- [Yubico OTP](xref:OtpYubicoOtp)
- [Initiative for Open Authentication HMAC-based OTP (OATH HOTP)](xref:OtpHotp)
- [Static password](xref:OtpStaticPassword)
- [Challenge-response (using the HMAC-SHA1 or Yubico OTP algorithms)](xref:OtpChallengeResponse)

YubiKeys that support NFC also include a configurable [NDEF](xref:OtpNdef) (NFC Data Exchange Format) tag. This tag can
be configured to point to a slot that is programmed with a Yubico OTP or an OATH HOTP in order to make the OTP easily
readable in NFC authentication scenarios.

Off-the-shelf YubiKeys come with the first slot preconfigured with a Yubico OTP (registered with
the [YubiCloud validation service](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubicloud/)) and the second slot empty.

## .NET SDK functionality

The SDK is designed to enable developers to accomplish common YubiKey OTP application configuration tasks:

- [Program a slot with a Yubico OTP credential](xref:OtpProgramYubicoOTP)
- [Program a slot with a static password](xref:OtpProgramStaticPassword)
- [Program a slot with a challenge-response credential](xref:OtpProgramChallengeResponse)
- [Calculate a response code for a challenge-response credential](xref:OtpCalcChallengeResponseCode)
- [Delete a slot’s configuration](xref:OtpDeleteSlotConfig)
- [Program a slot with an HMAC-SHA1 OATH-HOTP credential](xref:OtpProgramHOTP)
- [Retrieve a slot’s status](xref:OtpRetrieveSlotStatus)
- [Configure NDEF to use a slot to generate an OTP](xref:OtpConfigureNDEF)
- [Read information from an NDEF tag](xref:OtpReadNDEF)
- [Update slot settings](xref:OtpUpdateSlot)
- [Swap slot configurations](xref:OtpSwapSlot)
- [Set, reset, remove, and use slot access codes](xref:OtpSlotAccessCodes)
