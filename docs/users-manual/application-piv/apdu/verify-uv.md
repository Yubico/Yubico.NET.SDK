### Command APDU info

CLA | INS | P1 | P2 | Lc | Data | Le
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
00 | 20 | 00 | 96 | *variable* | *variable* | (absent)

The data bytes vary depending on the intended operation:
- none  - check the biometric state
- 02 00 - request a temporary PIN
- 03 00 - perform biometric verification

### Response APDU info

#### Response APDU for VERIFY (success)

Total Length: 2\
Data Length: 0

|   Data    | SW1 | SW2 |
|:---------:|:---:|:---:|
| (no data) | 90  | 00  |

#### Response APDU for VERIFY (success with temporary PIN)

Total Length: 18\
Data Length: 16

|     Data      | SW1 | SW2 |
|:-------------:|:---:|:---:|
| temporary PIN | 90  | 00  |

#### Response APDU for VERIFY (Invalid biometric match)

Total Length: 2\
Data Length: 0

|   Data    | SW1 |   SW2   |
|:---------:|:---:|:-------:|
| (no data) | 63  | C0 - C2 |

If the biometric match failed, the error is `63 CX` where *X* is the number of
retries remaining. When no retries remain, biometric verification becomes blocked, and the error returned is `0x6983` (`AuthenticationMethodBlocked`). To proceed in this situation, the [PIV PIN verification](xref:PivApduVerifyPIN) must be used.
