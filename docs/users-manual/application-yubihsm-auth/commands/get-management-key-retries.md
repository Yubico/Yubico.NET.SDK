# Get management key retries

Get the number of retries remaining for the management key.

Some operations require authentication with the management key (such as adding and deleting credentials). There is a
limit of 8 attempts to authenticate with the management key before the management key is blocked. Once the management
key is blocked, the application itself must be reset before authentication can be attempted again. To reset the
application, see [ResetApplicationCommand](xref:YubiHsmAuthCmdResetApplication). Supplying the correct management key
before the management key is blocked will reset the retry counter to 8.

## Available

All YubiKeys with the YubiHSM Auth application (included in firmware version 5.4.3 and later).
